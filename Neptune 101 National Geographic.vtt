00:00:00.492 --> 00:00:01.430
(mysterious music)

00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:02.650
- [Narrator] Along the dark edges

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:05.420
of the Solar System, it floats.

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.870
Anchored by a star but
barely graced by its warmth,

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:10.800
this traveler drifts alone

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.853
as deceptively calm and
elusive as the deep blue sea.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.273
Neptune is the eighth planet from the Sun.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.330
At about 30 times the distance

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.080
between our star and the Earth,
or 30 astronomical units,

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.220
Neptune is the most distant
planet in our Solar System.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.650
This distance creates the longest orbit

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.920
of the eight worlds, about 165 years,

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.920
with the seasons lasting little
over 40 Earth years each.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.380
Being so far away from the
heat and light of the Sun,

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.620
Neptune is cold, dark, and icy.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.490
At its heart is a solid core

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.570
about 1.5 times the size of Earth.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.170
Making up about 45% of the planet's mass,

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.600
the core is made of water
ice and silicate rock.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.680
The rest of the planet is believed to be

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.360
a hot pressurized ocean of
water, methane, and ammonia ices

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.950
surrounded by a layer of clouds.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.730
These clouds, predominantly
made of hydrogen and helium,

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.660
include traces of methane,

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.963
which give this ocean
world its rich blue color.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.860
While the clouds create a
cool, calm veneer from afar,

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.940
up close, they are whipped around

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.320
by the most severe weather
in the Solar System.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.240
Winds on the planet reach speeds

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.050
of over 1,200 miles per hour,
nearly five times faster

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.600
than the strongest
winds recorded on Earth.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.120
In fact, the winds are so powerful

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.163
that they break the sound barrier.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.370
Drifting high above this windy ice giant

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.363
is a quiet ecosystem of
rings and satellites.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.520
Six rings encircle the planet,

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.780
with some containing ring arcs,

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.050
or clusters of dust particles in a ring.

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.310
Also revolving around the
planet are 14 known moons,

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.940
with the largest called Triton.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.120
Named after the son of
the ancient Greek sea god,

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.420
Triton has ice volcanoes
and may even contain

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.023
a subsurface ocean.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.440
Much is left to be
discovered about Neptune,

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.690
its rings and its moons.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.730
Only one spacecraft, Voyager 2,

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.000
has visited these cosmic bodies,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.560
but future missions to
this mysterious icy world

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.793
would have even more stories to tell.
